The notes which I've written so far will be linked down below. These notes have been written by me for projects, as class notes, or out of pure interest in the topic. Some of the notes are handwritten, wheras others have been done in LaTeX.

I am aware that the notes might have many typos which might've been missed by me in proofreading; although I may or may not re-visit them again. If you find any typos or any errors in my notes, feel free to let me know [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfg5K7Who3oHfU4l4fgulXwf8h9csXvU88QPf83HDsMjE65XA/viewform?usp=sf_link)!
