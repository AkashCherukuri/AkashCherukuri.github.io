The Latex notes which I've written so far will be linked down below. These notes have been written by me for projects, as class notes, or out of pure interst in the topic.

I am aware that the notes might have many typos which might've been missed by me in proofreading; although I may or may not re-visit them again.

1) Data Structures and Algorithms written for SoS-2020. Here's the [repo](https://github.com/LightDrifter/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms) and here's the [pdf](https://github.com/LightDrifter/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/SoS_Report.pdf).
