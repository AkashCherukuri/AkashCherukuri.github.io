I plan on writing the reviews for a few games I enjoy here, as practice. I might divide them up based on their genre later, once there's too many. I try to follow a similar fashion for all the reviews, to maintain uniformity. Clicking on the hyperlinks below will take you to the respective review.

The rating guide, my biases, and why I've decided to put reviews up here has been discussed [here](/reviews/about/).
