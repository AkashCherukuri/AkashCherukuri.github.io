## Ranking System
I will be rating games on  a scale of 0 through 5. Each number's meaning has been explained below. I plan to be reasonably thorough with these reviews. 
- 0 -> Unplayable
- 1 -> Playable, but would not reccommend
- 2 -> Enjoyable, but with serious flaws
- 3 -> Reccommended, but with minor flaws
- 4 -> Highly Reccommended, respectable
- 5 -> Masterpiece


## Interests
I tend to enjoy faster, reflex based games more than strategic, slow-paced ones. Do keep in this in mind if you do intend to read the review, as I tend to be sterner towards such genres. My rating is my opinion alone, and is (obviously) not absolute.


## Why here?
Putting one's ideas into words effectively is an important skill to possess, be it an Engineer or otherwise. Similarly, being able to look at game design and analyzing how effectively it acheives (or fails to acheive) its goals requires critical thinking, which I wish to train upon. Games are just a medium I enjoy, and thus, makes the process of me honing my skills enjoyable.

I am putting it up on my website for everyone to view, and provide constructive feedback on; as it would ultimately help me in my journey no matter how small.
