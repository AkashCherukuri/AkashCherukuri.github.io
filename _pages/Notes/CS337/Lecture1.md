Consider the case where a model is to be trained to classify a fruit, given its shape and color. A model can be trained by giving the model training data **with true labels**, and this is called as *Supervised Learning*. Similarly, the desired output is not given in *unsupervised learning*.


Classification, regression - Supervised Learning
Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction - Unsupervised
