Modern Philosophy primarily consists of two schools of thought, *Rationalism* and *Empiricism*. Their epistemological discourse varied, with Rationalists claiming reason to be the primary source of all knowledge and empiricists claiming experience to be the primary source instead.

The spirit of modern philosophy emphasized the spirit of independence, and was marked by an awakening of the reflective spirit and quickening of criticism. Further more, there was:
- Demands for freedom in thought
- Revolt against absolutism and collectivism
- Revolt against authority

Focus shifted from contemplation of the supernatural to reflection on natural things. **Reason** was started to be taken as authority in science and philosophy. For example, a the Heliocentric theory was introduced in this era. Practical application of science in technology and medicine was also observed.

Rationalists and Empiricists debated on the nature of truth as well. Rationalists believed truth to be absolute, and be *a priori* in nature. The empiricists on the other hand felt truth to be *a posteriori* in nature, and disagreed that truth was absolute.

# Francis Bacon

Introduced the method of **Induction**. He believed that human knowledge mist be based on a firm foundation, and emphasized on the importance of social order in science and technology.

His obsession with order let him to be the first to document the Scientific Method. 

## The Scientific Method

> Novum Organum

The method introduced by Aristotle was teleological, where only the purpose of the object mattered. This method on the other hand utilizes *mathematics* and *methodological observation*. (math was ignored before)

Inductive methods are used to deduce mathematical laws. **Idolas**, or prejudices were encouraged to be ignored for an un-biased observation. Some examples of *Idolas* are:

1. Idola of Tribes - general tendencies to be decieved, such as a tendency to overgeneralize
2. Idola of the den - individualistic dispositions regarding education and authority
3. Idola fori - association of words and names of actual objects
4. Idola of theatre - result of false theories or philosophies

&nbsp;

## Induction

Not a case of simple enumeration. Investigate a group of entities with the goal centered around finding out a general cause. 

Simply deducing that all men are mortal by looking at a few people is NOT induction! {: .notice--warning}

*yeah I didn't really understand this, prof gave above as example..*

Deductive reasoning is only concerned with intuitively conceptualising statements, and not about facts. Induction is concerned with utilizing experience obtained by observation to verify facts. 

Implicitly, investigation is centered around finding the cause, meaning that a **causal relationship** was believed. 

There are three forms of induction:

1. Mill's method of Agreement
    Finding out qualities from positive instances

2. Mill's method of Difference
    Observing that a quality is lost when a form is taken away

3. Mill's Concomitant Variation
    The object of out inquiry is present in greater or lesser degree

# Thomas Hobbes

Gave a mechanistic explanation of reality, and tried to utilize science and philosophy practically. He had a heliocentric worldview, and argued in favour of materialistic philosophy. 

Thomas Hobbes was an Empricist.
{: .notice--info}

He believed that faith and feeling had to take a backseat as the source of knowledge.

## Theory of Knowledge

He states that senses are the origin of all thoughts - it persists and is retained in memory. Reasoning is a conceptual arithmetic, and thoughts are regulated by desire. 

He believed that all knowledge was *conditional*, and also that the mechanism of body was responsible for senses. (not some metaphysical stuff)

*yeah this is quite blurry*

# Rene Descartes

> "Father of Modern Philosphy"

Rene Descaretes was a Rationalist. He didn't outright reject the notion of god and the metaphysical like Hobbes, rather, he tried to prove the existence of god through logical arguments. 

He did believe that faith and feeling had to take a backseat as the source of knowledge, just like Hobbes. 

He utilized mathematics as the model for his philosophy. He used both the deductive methods and inductive methods in his works, which is a strength of his theory.

He clasified the sciences as follows:

1. **Metaphysics** is the principle of knowledge concerning God, immateriality of the soul and all clear and simple ideas that we possess

2. **Physics** is the principle of material things, such as the things examined in general

> "Philosophy as a whole is like a tree with metaphysics as its roots and physics as its trunk. All other sciences comprise of the branches from this trunk."

He also followed *Methodological Scepticism*, where Deductive and Inductive reasoning are used to arrive at a certain and indubitable truth. He was not a sceptist, however, as he wanted to use scepticism to reach certainity. 
{: .notice--warning}

He doesn't doubt truth itself, he rather doubts the methods used to arrive at the truths. He states the following as reasons for scepticism:

- truths in traditional scholastic systems
- experiences, as senses are deceiving
- difficult to distinct between dreaming and waking
- memory can be deceptive
- evil agents can be deceptive
- at times, demonstrations of mathematics can be deceptive (calculation mistakes...)

Doubting involves thinking. Therefore, there must be a doubter to doubt. Thus, "I doubt, therefore, I think, therefore, I am."

> "Dubito ergo cogito ergo sum"

### Proof for Existence of God

The motive of evils is to deceive. Humans are imperfect, and this implies the existence of a perfect and infinite being. God cannot deceive, since deception is evil and God cannot be evil.

*what? ^*

Descartes said that the idea of God is not derived from an external world via senses. That is, Rene Descartes felt that senses only affected us, but they did not reveal anything to us. Rather, it is an **innate** idea or an *a priori* idea.

Note that Descartes was before Newton, so he did not know *how* objects moved. It was all attributed to God being an Immovable Mover.

&nbsp;
### Proof for the Existence of World

We know that the world exists becuase of our feelings. The feelings of pleasure, pain, hunger and instinctive reactions are all proofs that the exernal world exists. However, these sensations can be deceiving. Such delusions can be corrected by the power of intellect endowed by god.

&nbsp;
### Existence of Bodies

Descartes was a **dualist**, he believed that mind and body were two seperate substances which exist independantly of one another.
{: .notice--info}

The essence of mind is thought, and the body is divisible whose essence is extension. Descartes firmly states that the mind and body are distinct, and are conveived **independently** of each other.

# John Locke

He was a Bri'ish empiricist, who did not agree with the ideas presented by Rene Descartes. He believed that all knowledge is accumulated post-birth via experience. He compared the mind with a blank slate, with knowledge being written on it.

&nbsp;
### Ideas

He believed there to be two sources of ideas:
1. *Sensation*
2. *Reflection*: (not the same as introspection...?)

He also categorized ideas into two types; Simple and Complex.
*Simple Ideas* are the ones which enter the mind by only one sense. *Complex Ideas* on the other hand are received by reflection by the mind on the ideas that it already has.

For example, "something black" is a simple idea but deducing that the black thing is a crow based on previus experiences and current state is a complex idea.

Some ideas are perceived through both sensation and reflection. Examples include pleasure, pain, power, existence, uneasiness, unity and so on. 

### Qualities

A quality of an object is the power that it has to produce ideas. 
1. Primary Quality - solidity, extension, , inherent in the object
2. Secondary Quality - sound, taste, colours

Secondary qualities are the qualities of an object which can be changed, wheras the primary qualities are relatively not changeable.

### Modes

A *simple mode* consists of variations of the same idea, repeated in different combinations without any mixture of the other. A *dozen or a score* is a mode obtained by successiv addition of unit.

*Mixed modes* are compounded simple ideas of several kinds put together to form a complex one. For example, beauty consists of many factors like colour, figure and so on.
