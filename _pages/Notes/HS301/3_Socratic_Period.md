The nature of philosophy in the pre-Socratic period was highly nature-centric in nature. In the socratic period however, philosophy was much more society-centered.

That is, it dabbled with ethics, and the importance and directions needed for living a pious and good life. The socratic period was marked by:

1. Beginning of Greek Enlightenment
2. Critical Thinking Encouraged - Departure from speculative thought
3. Individualism, and Freedom emphasized

This period was the rise of **Skepticism** and **Subjectivism**.
{: .notice--primary}

Skepticism has been defined earlier, followers believe that "true knowledge" is impossible to attain. *Subjectivism* says that different people can have different beliefs. *Fundamentalism* is a form of extreme subjectivism, where people assert that **ONLY** their beliefs are true.

Fundamentalism disrupts the harmony which is needed to progress knowledge.

Although naive theories full of gods and occult powers existed, a mechanical theory of **atomists** was around as well during this period.

First half of the period was full of natural philosophy of cosmos. Man's place was determined using Metaphysical conclusions. The second half was marked with a change in the political, economic and intellectual atmosphere. This is after the Great Persian war.

This new age was majorly due to the establishment of a democratic institution. This ushered in many great people such as Socrates and Hippocrates.


### Sophists

They were the representation of a new movement in Greece. These were wise and skillful people who worked as professional teachers and travellers. As a livelihood, they used to train people in:

- Dialects - Argumentative reasoning (Lawyers, for example), they tried to lead the other person into a contradiction (*Aphoria*)
- Grammar
- Rhetoric - Flow of speech
- Oratory

They were relevant because it was beneficial to be a good orator in democracy, as it opens up opportunities for one to better their life and influence others as well.

# Socrates

> "Virtue is Knowledge"

Socrates urged for clear and rational thinking, and emphasized that knowledge and virtue are necessary for society. That is, he gave importance to ethics.

As mentioned earlier, philosophy before Socrates was highly nature-centric but Socrates focused more on the betterment of society. He caused a shift in philosophy to be more society-centric in nature. 

Socrates was infatuated with finding the true meaning of *Knowledge*. To better understand it, he tried to establish *why* knowledge is important.

1. **Knowledge is Morality**

    Understanding the meaning of *Morality*, as it is important for the proper functioning of state and society.

2. **Knowledge is Virtue**

    He says that Virtue is good in itself, as a happy man usually is temperate, brave, wise and just.

    A teacher can transmit knowledge, values and rules. But *Socrates believed that Virtue cannot be taught*. That is, virtues are to be practiced and values are to be discovered. Every individual person must reflect on ones' self and use the knowledge gained to better themselves.

    A teacher's role is to cure social ills such as alchoholism and the such.

    Athenians however, weren't ready to accept and criticize themselves. This was because Athens was a very wealthy city-state; due to which people were ego-istic and self-centric in nature.

    Socrates believed that humans are reasonable, and stated that experts are required to understand what is just and unjust. He also emphasized the importance of establishing such a institution in Athens.

# Plato

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    Theory of Ideas
</div>

Plato felt that Socrates missed upon utilizing *Ontology* while discussing ethics, and took it upon himself to do so. He brought back Metaphysics into discussion.

He tried to compose a comprehensive philosophical system by drawing insights from other philosophers. This showed the link between epistemology, ontology and ethics. (human knowledge, existence and conduct)

He believed that genuine knowledge is unchanging and absolute; but our senses and experiences keep changing. (Latter was inspired by Heraclitus)

### Dialectical Method

This method is used for proper comprehension. We first try to generalize scattered particulars into a single idea, and then we try to classify this broad general idea into specific smaller classes. That is, this method consists of:

1. Generalization
2. Classification

This allows for clear and consistent thinking. This essentially is "Thinking in Concepts".

He introduced this because he felt that the Sophists' ideas were too cluttered and this caused confusion amongst the people regarding the true nature of things.

This requires that language has general words such as "similar" and "before", instead of just proper nouns. That is, you cannot say that a ~~Bamboo~~ Banyan Tree and a Oak Tree are similar without knowing what similarity is.


### Ideas for Plato

*Ideas, Plato vs Parmenides, revise and write down here*

Plato argues that ideas are universal and eternal, and that they aren't subject to change. Ideas correspond to an abstract concepts, and cannot be seen directly. 

Ideas are:
- non-temporal
- existing in an independant realm
- participate in particulars

That is, the idea of *horseness* is independant of the original horse it might have been based on; and exists on even after the original horse has died.


### Epistemology and Metaphysics

Plato beleived that knowledge is latent in the soul, bring both these branches together. He said that the soul can contemplate on pure eternal ideas.

*unity and diversity whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*


Plato believed that *Forms* are not related to the *Physical* world, that they existed in their own plane of existence.
