The nature of philosophy in the pre-Socratic period was highly nature-centric in nature. In the socratic period however, philosophy was much more society-centered.

That is, it dabbled with ethics, and the importance and directions needed for living a pious and good life. The socratic period was marked by:

1. Beginning of Greek Enlightenment
2. Critical Thinking Encouraged - Departure from speculative thought
3. Individualism, and Freedom emphasized

This period was the rise of **Skepticism** and **Subjectivism**.

Skepticism has been defined earlier, followers believe that "true knowledge" is impossible to attain. *Subjectivism* says that different people can have different beliefs. *Fundamentalism* is a form of extreme subjectivism, where people assert that **ONLY** their beliefs are true.

Fundamentalism disrupts the harmony which is needed to progress knowledge.

Although naive theories full of gods and occult powers existed, a mechanical theory of **atomists** was around as well during this period.

First half of the period was full of natural philosophy of cosmos. Man's place was determined using Metaphysical conclusions. The second half was marked with a change in the political, economic and intellectual atmosphere. This is after the Great Persian war.

This new age was majorly due to the establishment of a democratic institution. This ushered in many great people such as Socrates and Hippocrates.


### Sophists

They were the representation of a new movement in Greece. These were wise and skillful people who worked as professional teachers and travellers. As a livelihood, they used to train people in:

- Dialects - Argumentative reasoning (Lawyers, for example), they tried to lead the other person into a contradiction (*Aphoria*)
- Grammar
- Rhetoric - Flow of speech
- Oratory

They were relevant because it was beneficial to be a good orator in democracy, as it opens up opportunities for one to better their life and influence others as well.
