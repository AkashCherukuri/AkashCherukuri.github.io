Aristotle is a philosopher from the Socratic period as well. He was the disciple of PLato, and tried to be more systematic. He was responsible for:

- Division of Philosophy into branches (eg Metaphysics and Physics)
- Systematic casual explanations

> Philosophy as love of wisdom must be consistent and **scientific**

Aristotle's work was focused on the systematic reconstruction of philosophy, and the development of ethics.

He disliked the lack of scientific explanation in Plato's philosophy, especially regarding forms/ideas. He denied the division between *ideal* and *material*.

He beleived ethics to be *Anti-Hedonistic*, and *Intuitionsistic* in nature. He justified anti-hedonism by making a distinction between the pleasure of mind and pleasure of the body.
 




## Aristotles and Knowledge

Aristotle beleived that experience to be the basis of knowledge, and true knowledge could only be obtained after knowing reasons or causes for an occurence. 

(That is, he was neither an rationalist nor an empiricist) 

<!-- Metaphysics smth -->

He classified science into four categories:

1. Logic
2. Theoretical Sciences - Abstract knowledge like chemistry
3. Practical Sciecnes - means of conduct, ethics, politics
4. Productive Sciences - aesthetics, poetics 




## Inherence of Forms

Forms are not apart from things, but are inherent in them. They are eternally together; and matter combines with form to constitute individual things.

Plato thought the phenomenal world to be a shadow of the ideal, real world. The phenomenal world is not a copy of the real world. Rather, it is the real world.

This take by Aristotle advocated **Realism** and led to the progression of Natural Science.

## Hierarchy of Forms

Aristotle believed that **plurality of individual substances** exist in a hierarchial order, with matter at the bottom and Pure form/God at the top. He believed matter to be the primoridal stuff.

Every individual substance is a mixture of matter and form, and matter is responsible for giving an object its uniqueness and particularity.

Human reasoning can discern the form.

### Explanation of Change

*(Potentiality and Actuality)*

Plato's idea of forms does not tackle the concept of change as he beleived form to be non-temporal. Aristotle's ideas challenge this notion.

He beleived that there to be 4 reasons for a substance changing. Using clay for making a pot has been used as an example for understanding these reasons.

1. *Material Cause*: Clay is the basic, primordial stuff
2. *Efficient Cause*: Agent bringing change to primordial stuff (potter)

3. *Formal Cause*: Structure/Form of the pot 
4. *Final Cause*: Use of the pot


Formal and Final cause are closely interlinked with **Teleology**. Aristotle beleived that the best way to understand why things are the way they are, is to understand the purpose that they fulfil.

## Logic and Syllogism

Syllogism is demonstration in the form of deduction. It utilizes properly formed arguments to arrive at a conlclusion from premises reagrding a middle term.

Propositions being used in an argument are called as Premises. There are four kinds of propositions:

1. Universal Affirmative (A) - "All X is Y" (distribute subject)
2. Particular Affirmative (I) - "Some X is Y" (distribute none)

3. Universal Negative (E) - "No X is Y" (distributes both subj and pred)
4. Particular Negative (O) - "Some X is not Y" (distribute pred only)

Similarly, *Major Premise* is universal in nature and *Minor Premise* is particular in nature.


### Structure of Syllogism

- Terms
- Propositions
- Moods - Depends on the type of proposition
- Figures - Depends on the position of the middle term
- Rules

A proposition contains three terms: Subject, Predicate and the *Copula*(relates to both subject and predicate, "is/are").

Consider the below argument.

> All games are better than League of Legends

> Some games are unfinished

> Therefore, some unfinished games are better than League of Legends

The mood of the above argument is **AII**. The middle term appears as subject in both the premises, defining the *Figure* of the argument.

There are four relations between propositions:

1. **Contradictory**: A/O, I/E (negations)
2. **Contrary**: A/E ("hard opposites")
3. **Sub-Contrary**: I/O ("soft" opposites)
4. **Subaltern**: A→I, E→O (Superset)


### Rules

1. The fallacy of the undistributed middle: Middle term must be distributed atleast once
2. Illicit Major: Middle term not distributed in major premise
3. Illicit Minor: Middle term not distributed in minor premise
4. The fallacy of two exclusive premises: Two negative premises
