*Incomplete notes here, starting off about aristotle*

Aristotle believed that **plurality of individual substances** exist in a hierarchial order, with matter at the bottom and Pure form/God at the top.

### Explanation of Change and Teleology

He beleived that there to be 4 reasons for a substance changing. Using clay for making a pot has been used as an example for understanding these reasons.

1. *Material Cause*: Clay is the basic, primordial stuff
2. *Efficient Cause*: The potter shapes the clay
3. *Formal Cause*: Structure/Form of the pot 
4. *Final Cause*: Use of the pot

Formal and Final cause are closely interlinked with **Teleology**. Aristotle beleived that the best way to understand why things are the way they are, is to understand the purpose that they fulfil.
