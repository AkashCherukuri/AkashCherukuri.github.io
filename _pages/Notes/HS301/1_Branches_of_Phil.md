Broadly, Philosophy can be defined as the "Log of Wisdom".

**Philosopher** is a person who critiques existing philosophical ideas with proof (otherwise its just an opinion). They also try to "prove" whatever is acceptable.

Philosophy is  broken down into 4 major branches, given below. We will look at each of these branches at a surface level, to know what the reaches of the topic are.

1. Metaphysics
2. Epistemology
3. Logic
4. Ethics / Aesthetics


&nbsp; 

## Metaphysics 

Metaphysics is considered as the **First Philosophy** by Aristotle. He has also sub-divided Metaphysics into "three" branches, namely;

- **Ontology** - The science of *Qua Being* - General Nature of everything
- **Theology** - Highest kind of being (Divinity)
- **Universal Science** - First Principle - Truth of every existing thing, basis of proof or demonstration

Metaphysics has been affected in the renaissance era due to enlightenment and groups such as *Logical Positivists*. Today, it plays the role of disciplinary integration for the better understanding of the connections between different streams.

## Epistemology

*Epistemology* is a branch of philosophy, and is concerned with the theory of knowledge. Justification and debates are used to "prove" that an idea is "true". A justified belief is knowledge. A belief by itself is just an opinion or **doxa**.

A belief is proven by;

- Explanation: Should be a causual explanation (ie, what the cause of the thing is)

- Justification: Argue why the causual explanation is true.

- Understanding: */ whatttt /*

Back in the day, most knowledge consisted of passed down information from generation to generation. For progressing knowledge, it is important to *doubt* the validity of existing knowledge. This practice of doubting is called as *Skepticism* or *Pyrrhonism*.

In general, Skepticism suggests that knowledge is impossible.

In Indian Philosophy, knowledge is given by four sources:

1. *Pratyaksa* or by perception
2. *Anumana* or by inference
3. *Upamana* or by comparision
4. *Sabdda* or by testimonies from trusted people


There are two important schools of thought regarding the primary source knowledge:

1. *Rationalism*: Reason is primary source of knowledge
2. *Empiricism*: Experience is the primary source of knowledge

Do note that Rationalism doesn't say that reason is the *only* source, rather it says that its the main source. Similarly for empiricism.

## Logic and Arguments

In indian philo, Logic is known as *Tarka Shastra*. Logic is the science that evaluates arguments regarding a particular observation/reasoning.

That is, Logic is concerned with:

1. Proper construction of arguments (*Tarkas*)
2. Evaluating the validity of the argument


*/ This is what I have understood, not definition per se! /*
An argument is defined as a logical sentence that shows how a premise leads to the truth value of the proposition.

- An argument is valid/invalid if it follows certain laws
- Arguments can be made from true premises or false premises as well

For example, Rene Descartes was following *Methodological Skepticism* which said that true knowledge was attainable (opposite to what skepticism said). He would have to *justify* his thinking, and its *validity* would be judged by logic.


There are two different types of arguments;

1. Deductive Arguments

Introduced by Aristotle, this uses a universal premise to test the truth value/validity of another proposition/argument.

That is, if premises are true; then true conclusion *necessarily* follows from the premises.

2. Inductive Arguments

Introduced by Francis Bacon, the premises are based on previous experience and intuition. The concept of generalization is introduced here, and these arguments have methods to be followed when being applied.

## Ethics and Aesthetics

Ethics is conerned with morality, values and the theory of morals. An action being "good" or "right" depends on certain principles, and requires rigorous justification as to the same. This branch is important because "good" need not necessarily imply that the action is "just".

Similarly, Aesthetics are concerned with the following question

> What makes something look good?

Although not as important as other branches of philosophy, much of human brilliance can be seen here; as without an aesthetic appeal life would be dull.
