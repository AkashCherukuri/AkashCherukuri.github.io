# Context-Free-Languages

Context free grammar is defined by a four member tuple.


$$
G = (V,\Sigma, R,S)
$$


$V$ - Non terminal variables

$\Sigma$ - Alphabets of the language

$R$ - A relation between $V \rightarrow (V\cup\Sigma)^*$ 

$S$ - Start state



Languages are defined using CFGs by the property of induction. The base cases are defined first, after which the inductive cases are defined.
