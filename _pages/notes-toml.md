These notes contain the theoretical aspect of Machine Learning; and have been made during the winter vacation of 2020. _Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms (c) 2014 by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David_ has been taken as the main reference while reading up on this topic.

The notes have been divided into two parts, the first pdf is handwritten and contains the nomenclature and some basic derivations. The decond pdf is typed, and is where most of the time has been spent by me.
